# Introduction

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

Welcome to the **Mesh API Documentation** - your comprehensive guide to integrating with the Mesh trading platform.

## What is Mesh API?

Mesh API is a modern, gRPC-based financial trading platform API organized into business domains including Identity & Access Management, Trading Services, Compliance Services, Wallet Management, and Issuance Hub.

For a complete overview of all available services and their current status, see the **[Services Reference](./api-reference/)**.

## Quick Start

Get started with the Mesh API using the API User Service.

### 1. Create an API User and Credentials

1. Log in as an administrator into the Mesh platform and go to the api users tab on the **[administration page](https://app.mesh.trade/administration/manage/api-users)**. From here Select the Create API user button.
![Administration API Keys Create](./introduction/administration-api-keys-create.png)

2. Enter a name for the api user (not unique) and select one or more roles. These roles will be assigned in the group that will own the new api user, this is also the top level group of the client that you are logged in as. This is relevant because Mesh is a multitenant hierarchal system. Read through the **[Group Ownership Guide](./architecture/group-ownership)** to understand this further. Select Create api user to complete the creation.

</div>

3. On successful creation a dialog opens with the new api user credentials. This download or copy them. They are required to authenticate communicaiton with them mesh API.

### 2. Installation

Install the SDK for your preferred language:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="go" label="Go">

```bash
# Install the Go SDK
go get github.com/meshtrade/api/go
```

Requirements: [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) version 1.21 or above

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```bash
# Install the Python SDK
pip install meshtrade
```

Requirements: [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version 3.9 or above

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 3. Set Up Credentials

Set up your api credentials so that they can be found by the sdk.

```bash
export MESH_API_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/your/credentials.json
```

**Credentials file format:**
```json
{
  "api_key": "your-api-key",
  "group_id": "your-group-id"
}
```

:::tip
Keep your API key secure and never commit it to version control.
:::

### 4. Your First API Request

Create and manage an API user using the credentials file:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="go" label="Go">

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "log"

    api_userv1 "github.com/meshtrade/api/go/iam/api_user/v1"
    rolev1 "github.com/meshtrade/api/go/iam/role/v1"
)

func main() {
    // Create API User Service client (loads credentials from MESH_API_CREDENTIALS)
    client, err := api_userv1.NewApiUserServiceGRPCClient()
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to create client: %v", err)
    }
    defer client.Close()

    // Create a new API user
    apiUser, err := client.CreateApiUser(
        context.Background(),
        &api_userv1.CreateApiUserRequest{
            ApiUser: &api_userv1.APIUser{
                DisplayName: "My First API User",
                Roles: []rolev1.Role{
                    rolev1.Role_ROLE_IAM_VIEWER,
                },
            },
        },
    )
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to create API user: %v", err)
    }

    log.Printf("Created API user: %s", apiUser.Name)
    log.Printf("API key: %s", apiUser.ApiKey) // Save this securely!
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
import grpc
import json
import os
from meshtrade.iam.api_user.v1 import service_pb2, service_pb2_grpc, api_user_pb2
from meshtrade.option.v1 import role_pb2

def load_credentials():
    """Load credentials from MESH_API_CREDENTIALS file."""
    creds_path = os.getenv('MESH_API_CREDENTIALS')
    with open(creds_path, 'r') as f:
        return json.load(f)

def main():
    # Load credentials
    creds = load_credentials()
    
    # Create gRPC channel and client
    channel = grpc.insecure_channel('api.mesh.dev:443')
    client = service_pb2_grpc.ApiUserServiceStub(channel)
    
    # Authentication metadata
    metadata = [
        ('authorization', f'Bearer {creds["api_key"]}'),
        ('x-group-id', creds['group_id']),
    ]
    
    try:
        # Create a new API user
        api_user = api_user_pb2.APIUser(
            display_name="My First API User",
            roles=[role_pb2.Role.ROLE_IAM_VIEWER]
        )
        
        request = service_pb2.CreateApiUserRequest(api_user=api_user)
        response = client.CreateApiUser(request, metadata=metadata)
        
        print(f"Created API user: {response.name}")
        print(f"API key: {response.api_key}")  # Save this securely!
        
    except grpc.RpcError as e:
        print(f"Failed to create API user: {e}")
    
    finally:
        channel.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The client will automatically load your credentials and use default configuration.
