# Group Ownership Structure

Understanding how groups provide ownership and isolation boundaries for your resources in the Mesh API.

## What are Groups?

Groups are the fundamental unit of organization and ownership in Mesh. Every resource (API users, accounts, orders, etc.) belongs to exactly one group, providing:

- **Multi-tenancy** - Logical separation between different organizations
- **Resource Isolation** - Resources in one group cannot access resources in another
- **Permission Boundaries** - Access control is enforced at the group level

All API operations require a group context and only return resources that belong to the authenticated group.

*This section will be expanded with more detailed information about group management and hierarchy in future updates.*
