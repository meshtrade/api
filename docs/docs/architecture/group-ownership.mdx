# Group Ownership Structure

## What are Groups?

Groups are the fundamental organizational and ownership units in Mesh.
They provide hierarchical ownership and multi-tenancy boundaries for all resources.
Every resource in the system (API users, accounts, orders, instruments, etc.) belongs to exactly one group.
Groups themselves can own other groups, forming hierarchical tree structures that
model real-world organizational relationships.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Resource Ownership**: Every entity in the system has an owner group
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Groups can own sub-groups, creating tree structures
- **Multi-tenancy Boundaries**: Groups provide complete isolation between organizations
- **Permission Inheritance**: Access rights flow down the hierarchy

## Universal User System: API Users & Regular Users

**Important**: While this documentation focuses on "API users" due to its technical API context, the **exact same ownership and permission system applies to regular users** who access Mesh through web interfaces, mobile apps, and other user-facing applications.

### Unified Authorization Model

**Both user types follow identical patterns:**
- **Regular Users**: Authenticate via username/password, OAuth providers (Google, Microsoft, etc.), or SSO systems
- **API Users**: Authenticate via API keys for programmatic access
- **Same Permissions**: Both receive identical role assignments within groups
- **Same Ownership**: Both are subject to the same hierarchical ownership rules
- **Same Access Control**: Both follow the same READ/WRITE method restrictions

### Digital Infrastructure Structuring

This system enables organizations to structure their **complete digital infrastructure** around groups:

**Enterprise Use Cases:**
- **Employee Access**: Regular users logging into web dashboards with group-based permissions
- **System Integration**: API users enabling automated workflows and integrations  
- **Unified Management**: Single ownership hierarchy governing both human and system access
- **Consistent Security**: Same authorization model across all access methods

**Example: Trading Firm Structure**
- **Executives**: Regular users with broad read access across all groups via web interface
- **Traders**: Regular users with trading permissions in specific desk groups via mobile/web apps
- **Risk Systems**: API users with read-only access for automated monitoring and reporting
- **Order Management**: API users with trading permissions for algorithmic execution

Throughout the examples below, we reference "API users" for technical precision, but understand that **regular users would appear in identical organizational positions** with the same role assignments and access patterns.

## Group Hierarchy Model

Groups form tree structures with sophisticated ownership tracking:

### Ownership Model

Each group (and every other resource) maintains ownership relationships:

- **`owner`** (Direct Owner): The immediate parent group that directly owns this resource
- **Hierarchical Path**: The system internally maintains the complete ownership chain from root to immediate parent for efficient access control

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Group Ownership Fields"
        Root["Root Group
        name: groups/01ABC123...XYZ
        owner: groups/01ABC123...XYZ (self)"]

        CompanyA["Company A Group
        name: groups/01DEF456...ABC
        owner: groups/01ABC123...XYZ"]

        TeamX["Team X Group
        name: groups/01GHI789...DEF
        owner: groups/01DEF456...ABC"]

        Account["User Account
        name: accounts/01JKL012...GHI
        owner: groups/01GHI789...DEF"]

        Root --> CompanyA
        CompanyA --> TeamX
        TeamX --> Account
    end
```

### Hierarchical Benefits

The system's internal hierarchical tracking provides:
- **Efficient Access Queries**: Find all resources accessible to a group through optimized ancestry checks
- **Permission Inheritance**: Resources inherit access permissions from all ancestors
- **Organizational Modeling**: Mirror real-world company structures and business units

## Everything is Owned

Every resource in Mesh has an owner group. This includes everything from clients, regular users, and API users through to accounts, financial instruments and different trade types.

        Account1 --> Order1
        Account2 --> Order2
        
        CompanyA --> Instrument1
    end
```

## Access Control: Hierarchical vs Direct Ownership

The Mesh API enforces different access patterns based on method type:

### Reading Methods (METHOD_TYPE_READ)

**Rule**: Can access resources owned by your executing group OR any descendant groups in the hierarchy.

**Implementation**: The system internally maintains hierarchical relationships to determine access based on group ancestry.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Read: Hierarchical Scope"
        Root["🏢 Root Group
groups/ROOT"]
        CompanyA["🏢 Company A
groups/COMP_A
🔍 Executing Group"]
        TeamX["👥 Team X
groups/TEAM_X"]
        TeamY["👥 Team Y
groups/TEAM_Y"]

        Res1["📊 Resource 1
owner: COMP_A
✅ Accessible"]
        Res2["📊 Resource 2
owner: TEAM_X
✅ Accessible"]
        Res3["📊 Resource 3
owner: TEAM_Y
✅ Accessible"]
        Res4["📊 Resource 4
owner: OTHER_COMP
❌ Not Accessible"]
        
        Root --> CompanyA
        CompanyA --> TeamX
        CompanyA --> TeamY
        
        CompanyA -.-> Res1
        TeamX -.-> Res2
        TeamY -.-> Res3
        
        style CompanyA fill:#e1f5fe
        style Res1 fill:#c8e6c9
        style Res2 fill:#c8e6c9
        style Res3 fill:#c8e6c9
        style Res4 fill:#ffcdd2
    end
```

**Example**: If *executing* as Company A **Group**, you can read:
- Resources directly owned by Company A
- Resources owned by the Team X group (descendant)
- Resources owned by the Team Y group (descendant)
- But NOT resources owned by other company groups

### Writing Methods (METHOD_TYPE_WRITE)

**Rule**: Can only access resources directly owned by your **executing group**.

**Implementation**: Uses the `owner` field to check exact ownership match with executing group.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Write: Direct Ownership"
        Root["🏢 Root Group
groups/ROOT"]
        CompanyA["🏢 Company A
groups/COMP_A
🔍 Executing Group"]
        TeamX["👥 Team X
groups/TEAM_X"]
        TeamY["👥 Team Y
groups/TEAM_Y"]

        Res1["📊 Resource 1
owner: groups/COMP_A
✅ Writable"]
        Res2["📊 Resource 2
owner: groups/TEAM_X
❌ Not Writable"]
        Res3["📊 Resource 3
owner: groups/TEAM_Y
❌ Not Writable"]
        Res4["📊 Resource 4
owner: groups/OTHER_COMP
❌ Not Writable"]
        
        Root --> CompanyA
        CompanyA --> TeamX
        CompanyA --> TeamY
        
        CompanyA -.-> Res1
        TeamX -.-> Res2
        TeamY -.-> Res3
        
        style CompanyA fill:#e1f5fe
        style Res1 fill:#c8e6c9
        style Res2 fill:#ffcdd2
        style Res3 fill:#ffcdd2
        style Res4 fill:#ffcdd2
    end
```

**Example**: If executing as Company A, you can write:
- Only resources directly owned by Company A
- NOT resources owned by Team X or Team Y (even though they're descendants)
- NOT resources owned by other companies

## Integration with Role-Based Access Control

Groups work in conjunction with the role-based access control system:

### Authentication Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant API
    participant AuthSystem
    participant ResourceService
    
    Client->>API: Request with x-api-key & x-group headers
    API->>AuthSystem: Validate API key & group context
    AuthSystem->>AuthSystem: Check user has required role in specified group
    AuthSystem->>API: Authentication successful
    API->>ResourceService: Execute with group context
    ResourceService->>ResourceService: Apply ownership filters based on method type
    ResourceService->>API: Return accessible resources
    API->>Client: Response with filtered data
```

### Role Assignment and Group Context

**API Credentials Structure:**
- **API Key**: Identifies the user
- **Group Context Header** (`x-group`): Specifies which group the operation executes within
- **Role Assignment**: User must have appropriate role assigned within the specified group

**Access Requirements:**
1. **Valid API Key**: Must be active and not expired
2. **Group Access**: User must have role assignment in the specified group
3. **Method Permissions**: User's role must include access to the specific API method
4. **Resource Ownership**: Resource must pass ownership filter based on method type

### Role-Based Method Access

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Role-Based Access Matrix"
        AdminRole["👤 IAM Admin Role
ROLE_IAM_ADMIN"]
        ViewerRole["👤 IAM Viewer Role
ROLE_IAM_VIEWER"]

        ReadMethods["📖 Read Methods
GetGroup, ListGroups, SearchGroups
METHOD_TYPE_READ"]
        WriteMethods["✏️ Write Methods
CreateGroup, UpdateGroup
METHOD_TYPE_WRITE"]
        
        AdminRole --> ReadMethods
        AdminRole --> WriteMethods
        ViewerRole --> ReadMethods
        ViewerRole -.-> WriteMethods
        
        style AdminRole fill:#c8e6c9
        style ViewerRole fill:#fff3e0
        style WriteMethods fill:#ffcdd2
    end
```

**Permission Model:**
- **Admin Roles** (`*_ADMIN`): Full read and write access to domain operations
- **Viewer Roles** (`*_VIEWER`): Read-only access for monitoring and auditing
- **Domain Separation**: Roles are scoped to specific business domains (IAM, Trading, Compliance, etc.)

### Example: Complete Access Check

For a `CreateGroup` operation:

1. **Authentication**: Validate API key and extract user identity
2. **Group Context**: Verify `x-group` header specifies valid group
3. **Role Check**: User must have `ROLE_IAM_ADMIN` or `ROLE_IAM_GROUP_ADMIN` in specified group
4. **Method Authorization**: `CreateGroup` requires write method permissions
5. **Ownership Validation**: New group's owner must match executing group (direct ownership rule)
6. **Hierarchy Update**: System automatically maintains hierarchical relationships for new group

## Practical Examples

### Multi-Tenant Brokerage Platform

This example demonstrates how groups represent **legal entities** at every level of the hierarchy. Each group corresponds to a real-world legal entity (individual, corporation, trust, etc.) that undergoes KYC/compliance verification by its parent group.

**Legal Entity Hierarchy:**
- **Mesh Platform**: The root legal entity providing the platform infrastructure
- **Broker Companies**: Legal entities (corporations) that are KYC'd by Mesh and provide brokerage services
- **Client Entities**: Legal entities (individuals, companies, trusts) that are KYC'd by their respective brokers

**Key Legal Entity Relationships:**

**Compliance Chain:**
- **Mesh Platform** ← KYC'd by regulators/auditors ← **Broker A & B** ← KYC'd by Mesh ← **Client Entities** ← KYC'd by their brokers

**Entity Types Supported:**
- **Natural Persons**: Individual traders and investors (`CLIENT_A1`)
- **Corporations**: Investment companies and fund managers (`CLIENT_A2`)
- **Trusts & Foundations**: Estate planning and wealth management entities (`CLIENT_B1`)
- **Financial Institutions**: Broker-dealers and registered investment advisors (`BROKER_A`, `BROKER_B`)

**Access Scenarios:**

**Broker A Admin executing ListAccounts (READ method):**
- ✅ Can see Account A1-Main (descendant: CLIENT_A1)
- ✅ Can see Account A2-Trading (descendant: CLIENT_A2)  
- ❌ Cannot see Account B1-Settlement (different broker)

**John Smith (Regular User) executing CreateOrder via Web Interface (WRITE method):**
- ✅ Can create orders owned by CLIENT_A1 (his legal entity group)
- ❌ Cannot create orders owned by CLIENT_A2 (different client)
- ❌ Cannot create orders owned by BROKER_A (not direct ownership)
- **Access Method**: Logs in via username/password, same authorization rules apply

**John's Trading Bot (API User) executing CreateOrder via API (WRITE method):**
- ✅ Can create orders owned by CLIENT_A1 (same ownership as regular user)
- ❌ Cannot create orders owned by CLIENT_A2 (different client)
- ❌ Cannot create orders owned by BROKER_A (not direct ownership)
- **Access Method**: Authenticates via API key, identical permissions to regular user

**Sarah Johnson (Regular User) executing GetAccount via Mobile App (READ method):**
- ✅ Can view CLIENT_A2 corporate accounts (her group's resources)
- ✅ Can view parent group accounts (hierarchical READ access)
- ❌ Cannot view CLIENT_A1 individual accounts (different client branch)
- **Cross-Platform**: Same permissions whether using web dashboard, mobile app, or desktop client

**Corporate Risk System (API User) executing ListOrders via API (READ method):**
- ✅ Can read all CLIENT_A2 orders for risk analysis
- ✅ Can read parent group data for consolidated reporting
- ❌ Cannot read CLIENT_A1 orders (different ownership branch)
- **Automation**: Enables automated risk monitoring with same permission model

- ✅ Can create orders owned by `BOND_DESK` (his department group)
- ❌ Cannot create orders owned by `FOREX_DESK` (different desk)
- ❌ Cannot create orders owned by `ALPHA_FUND` (different entity level)
- **Authentication**: SSO/Active Directory with role-based terminal access
- **Interface**: Desktop trading terminal with real-time market data

**Bond Algo System (API User) executing CreateOrder via API (WRITE method):**
- ✅ Can create orders owned by `BOND_DESK` (same permissions as regular trader)
- ❌ Cannot create orders owned by `FOREX_DESK` (same restrictions apply)
- ❌ Cannot create orders owned by `ALPHA_FUND` (entity separation maintained)
