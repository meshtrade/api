# Role-Based Access Control

Understanding how business domain roles control method-level access within the Mesh API's hierarchical group ownership system.

## Overview

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Mesh operates as a **two-layer security model** where roles define **what operations** users can perform, while groups define **which resources** they can access. This creates a comprehensive authorization system that combines business-level permissions with organizational hierarchy constraints.

**The Dual Authorization Model:**
- **Roles** (this document): Control method-level access to API operations
- **Groups** ([Group Ownership](./group-ownership)): Control resource-level access through ownership hierarchy

Our guiding principle is using the **Protobuf schema as the single source of truth** for all authorization rules, ensuring our security model is self-documenting, automatically verifiable, and always in sync with the API contract.

## What are Roles?

Roles are **enum values** that provide implicit access to API methods within business domains. Unlike traditional permission systems with explicit permission strings, Mesh roles work by **method-level declaration** - each RPC method explicitly declares which role enum values can access it in its protobuf definition.

**Key Distinction:**
- **No Explicit Permissions**: Roles don't contain lists of permission strings
- **Method-Level Grants**: API methods declare which roles can access them via protobuf annotations
- **Implicit Authorization**: Having a role grants access to methods that declare that role
- **Enum-Based Design**: Roles are simple enum constants, not complex permission objects

Each role represents a coherent set of capabilities that align with real-world job functions and responsibilities through the methods that reference them.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Domain-Scoped**: Roles are organized by business domains (Trading, Wallet, IAM, etc.)
- **Method-Level Control**: Each RPC method explicitly declares which roles can access it
- **Business-Aligned**: Role names reflect actual business functions and responsibilities
- **Hierarchical Permissions**: Admin roles include all viewer capabilities plus write operations

## Universal User System: API Users & Regular Users

**Important**: While this documentation focuses on "API users" for technical precision, the **exact same role-based permission system applies to regular users** accessing Mesh through web interfaces, mobile applications, and desktop software.

### Unified Role Assignment Model

**Both user types receive identical role assignments:**
- **Regular Users**: Login via username/password, OAuth (Google, Microsoft), or SSO systems
- **API Users**: Authenticate via API keys for programmatic integration
- **Same Roles**: Both receive identical role assignments within groups (e.g., `ROLE_TRADING_ADMIN`)
- **Same Method Access**: Both are subject to the same protobuf method-level authorization rules
- **Same Business Logic**: Identical permission validation regardless of authentication method

### Digital Infrastructure Applications

This role system enables comprehensive **enterprise digital infrastructure management**:

**Complete Access Control:**
- **Employee Access**: Staff using web dashboards, mobile apps, and desktop clients with role-based permissions
- **System Integration**: API-driven workflows, automation, and third-party integrations with same role restrictions
- **Unified Governance**: Single role model governing human users and automated systems
- **Consistent Security**: Same authorization logic across all access methods and interfaces

**Example: Financial Services Organization**
- **Portfolio Managers**: Regular users with `ROLE_TRADING_ADMIN` accessing web trading platforms
- **Risk Analysts**: Regular users with `ROLE_TRADING_VIEWER` using mobile dashboards for monitoring  
- **Trading Algorithms**: API users with `ROLE_TRADING_ADMIN` for automated execution systems
- **Compliance Systems**: API users with `ROLE_COMPLIANCE_VIEWER` for automated reporting and monitoring

Throughout the examples below, we reference "API users" for technical clarity, but understand that **regular users appear in identical organizational roles** with the same permissions and access patterns.

## Role Hierarchy by Business Domain

The Mesh API organizes roles into six core business domains, each with a consistent permission structure:

```mermaid

            WalletAccViewer["👁️ ROLE_WALLET_ACCOUNT_VIEWER<br/>Account read access"]
        end
        
        subgraph "Trading Domain"

            IAMAPIViewer["👁️ ROLE_IAM_API_USER_VIEWER<br/>API user read access"]
        end
        
        subgraph "Compliance Domain"
            CompAdmin["👤 ROLE_COMPLIANCE_ADMIN<br/>Compliance operations"]
            CompViewer["👁️ ROLE_COMPLIANCE_VIEWER<br/>Compliance read access"]
        end

            IssuanceViewer["👁️ ROLE_STUDIO_VIEWER<br/>Issuance read access"]
        end
        
        subgraph "Reporting Domain"

            ReportingViewer["👁️ ROLE_REPORTING_VIEWER<br/>Report access"]
        end
    end
```

### Role Naming Convention

All roles follow a consistent pattern: `ROLE_{DOMAIN}_{SCOPE}_{ACCESS_LEVEL}`

- **Domain**: Business area (WALLET, TRADING, IAM, COMPLIANCE, ISSUANCE_HUB, REPORTING)
- **Scope**: Specific resource type (optional - e.g., ACCOUNT, USER, GROUP, API_USER)
- **Access Level**: Permission tier (ADMIN, VIEWER)

## Permission Levels: Admin vs Viewer

Each domain implements a two-tier permission model that aligns with common organizational needs:

### Admin Roles (`*_ADMIN`)

**Capabilities:**
- **Full Read Access**: All GET, LIST, SEARCH operations within domain
- **Full Write Access**: All CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE operations within domain
- **Resource Management**: Lifecycle operations for domain resources
- **Configuration Control**: Modify settings and parameters

**Use Cases:**
- Service administrators and operators
- Domain experts managing resources
- Automation systems requiring full control

### Viewer Roles (`*_VIEWER`)

**Capabilities:**
- **Read-Only Access**: GET, LIST, SEARCH operations only
- **Monitoring and Auditing**: Access for compliance and oversight
- **Reporting and Analytics**: Data access for analysis
- **No Modification Rights**: Cannot CREATE, UPDATE, or DELETE

**Use Cases:**
- Auditors and compliance officers
- Analysts and reporting systems
- Monitoring and observability tools
- Junior staff requiring supervised access

## Integration with Group Ownership System

Roles and groups work together to create a comprehensive authorization model. **Both** must be satisfied for an operation to succeed:

### The Dual Gate Model

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant API Gateway
    participant Auth Service
    participant Resource Service
    participant Database
    
    Client->>API Gateway: Request with API key + group context
    API Gateway->>Auth Service: Validate credentials
    
    Auth Service->>Auth Service: 1. Verify API key validity
    Auth Service->>Auth Service: 2. Check user has role in specified group
    Auth Service->>Auth Service: 3. Verify role grants method access
    
    Auth Service->>API Gateway: ✅ Role authorization passed
    API Gateway->>Resource Service: Forward request with context
    
    Resource Service->>Resource Service: 4. Apply ownership filter based on method type
    Resource Service->>Database: Query with ownership constraints
    Database->>Resource Service: Return filtered results
    
    Resource Service->>API Gateway: ✅ Resource access authorized
    API Gateway->>Client: Response with accessible data
```

### Authorization Requirements

For any API operation, **all four** requirements must be met:

1. **Valid Credentials**: Active API key with proper authentication
2. **Group Membership**: User must have role assignment in the specified group
3. **Method Authorization**: User's role must include access to the specific RPC method
4. **Resource Ownership**: Resources must pass ownership filter based on method type

## Method-Level Role Declaration

Each API method explicitly declares which roles can access it using protobuf annotations:

### Single Role Access

```protobuf
rpc CreateAccount(CreateAccountRequest) returns (Account) {
  option (meshtrade.option.v1.method_type) = METHOD_TYPE_WRITE;
  option (meshtrade.iam.role.v1.roles) = {
    roles: [ROLE_WALLET_ADMIN]
  };
}
```

### Multiple Role Access (Admin + Specialized)

```protobuf
rpc CreateAccount(CreateAccountRequest) returns (Account) {
  option (meshtrade.option.v1.method_type) = METHOD_TYPE_WRITE;
  option (meshtrade.iam.role.v1.roles) = {
    roles: [
      ROLE_WALLET_ADMIN,
      ROLE_WALLET_ACCOUNT_ADMIN
    ]
  };
}
```

### Read Access (Admin + Viewer)

```protobuf
rpc GetLimitOrder(GetLimitOrderRequest) returns (LimitOrder) {
  option (meshtrade.option.v1.method_type) = METHOD_TYPE_READ;
  option (meshtrade.iam.role.v1.roles) = {
    roles: [
      ROLE_TRADING_ADMIN,
      ROLE_TRADING_VIEWER
    ]
  };
}
```

    end
```

**Cross-Domain Access Patterns:**

**Platform Lead in Platform Team context:**
- **IAM Operations**: Full admin access to create/modify users, groups, API users
- **Wallet Operations**: Can create test accounts, manage account lifecycle
- **Resource Scope**: Can access Platform Team + Test Environment resources
- **Use Case**: Setting up development infrastructure and user accounts

**DevOps Admin in DevOps Team context:**  
- **IAM Operations**: Can manage service accounts and automation users
- **Reporting Operations**: Full access to generate and configure system reports
- **Resource Scope**: Limited to DevOps Team owned resources
- **Cross-Domain**: Cannot access Platform Team's test accounts (different ownership branch)

**QA Lead in QA Team context:**
- **Trading Operations**: Read-only access to verify trading functionality
- **Compliance Operations**: Read access for regulatory testing scenarios
- **Resource Limitation**: Cannot create accounts or modify trading data
- **Scope Restriction**: No access to production or development team resources

## Role Assignment and Management

### API User Role Configuration

API Users receive role assignments within specific groups, creating the foundation for the authorization system:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Role Assignment Model"
        APIUser["🔑 API User<br/>api_users/USER_123"]
        
        GroupA["🏢 Group A<br/>groups/GROUP_A"]
        GroupB["🏢 Group B<br/>groups/GROUP_B"]
        GroupC["🏢 Group C<br/>groups/GROUP_C"]
        
        APIUser -.->|"Roles: [TRADING_ADMIN,<br/>WALLET_VIEWER]"| GroupA
        APIUser -.->|"Roles: [IAM_VIEWER]"| GroupB
        APIUser -.->|"Roles: [REPORTING_VIEWER]"| GroupC
        
        style APIUser fill:#e3f2fd
        style GroupA fill:#c8e6c9
        style GroupB fill:#fff3e0
        style GroupC fill:#fce4ec
    end
```

**Key Principles:**
- **Per-Group Assignment**: Same user can have different roles in different groups
- **Context Switching**: User specifies execution group via `x-group` header
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Assign minimal roles necessary for function
- **Scope Isolation**: Roles in one group don't grant access to other groups

### Best Practices for Role Assignment

**Organizational Alignment:**
- **Map to Job Functions**: Assign roles that match actual responsibilities
- **Consider Hierarchy**: Senior roles often need broader access across domains
- **Separate Concerns**: Don't grant admin roles when viewer access suffices

**Security Considerations:**
- **Regular Auditing**: Review and validate role assignments periodically  
- **Temporary Elevation**: Use time-limited roles for special operations
- **Cross-Training**: Multiple people should have critical admin roles
- **Automation Accounts**: Service accounts should have minimal required roles

## Advanced Authorization Patterns

### Cross-Domain Operations

Many real-world operations require access across multiple business domains:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Cross-Domain Operation: Account-Based Trading"
        User["👤 Portfolio Manager<br/>Roles: [WALLET_VIEWER, TRADING_ADMIN]"]
        
        GetAccount["1. GetAccount<br/>📊 METHOD_TYPE_READ<br/>Requires: WALLET_VIEWER"]
        CreateOrder["2. CreateOrder<br/>✏️ METHOD_TYPE_WRITE<br/>Requires: TRADING_ADMIN"]
        
        Account["💰 Trading Account<br/>Balance: $50,000"]
        Order["📈 Buy Order<br/>Amount: $10,000"]
        
        User --> GetAccount
        User --> CreateOrder
        GetAccount --> Account
        CreateOrder --> Order
        
        style GetAccount fill:#e8f5e8
        style CreateOrder fill:#fff3e0
    end
```

### Specialized Role Hierarchies

Some domains implement additional role granularity for specific resource types:

**Wallet Domain Specialization:**
- `ROLE_WALLET_ADMIN`: Full wallet operations across all resource types
- `ROLE_WALLET_ACCOUNT_ADMIN`: Specialized for account lifecycle management
- `ROLE_WALLET_ACCOUNT_VIEWER`: Read-only access to account data

**IAM Domain Specialization:**
- `ROLE_IAM_ADMIN`: Complete identity and access management
- `ROLE_IAM_USER_ADMIN`: Focus on user lifecycle and profile management  
- `ROLE_IAM_GROUP_ADMIN`: Group hierarchy and organizational structure management
- `ROLE_IAM_API_USER_ADMIN`: API credential and integration management

## Security Architecture Integration

### Defense in Depth

The role system implements multiple security layers:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Security Layers"
        L1["🌐 Network Security<br/>TLS, VPN, Firewalls"]
        L2["🔐 Authentication<br/>API Key Validation"]
        L3["👤 Role Authorization<br/>Method-Level Access Control"]
        L4["🏢 Resource Authorization<br/>Group Ownership Filtering"]
        L5["📊 Audit & Monitoring<br/>Access Logging & Analytics"]
        
        L1 --> L2
        L2 --> L3
        L3 --> L4
        L4 --> L5
        
        style L3 fill:#c8e6c9
        style L4 fill:#e1f5fe
    end
```

### Threat Model Considerations

**Privilege Escalation Prevention:**
- Roles cannot be self-assigned or modified by holders
- Group context switching requires existing role assignment
- Resource access is always filtered through ownership model

**Lateral Movement Limitation:**
- Roles are scoped to specific business domains
- Group boundaries provide organizational isolation
- Cross-domain access requires explicit multi-role assignment

**Audit and Compliance:**
- All authorization decisions are logged and traceable
- Role assignments are immutable audit events
- Access patterns can be analyzed for anomaly detection

## Performance and Scalability

### Authorization Caching Strategy

The role system is designed for high-performance operation:

**API Key Resolution:**
- User identity and group role assignments cached at API gateway
- Cache invalidation on role assignment changes
- Distributed cache for horizontal scaling

**Method Permission Lookup:**
- Role-to-method mappings pre-computed from protobuf definitions
- Static configuration eliminates runtime permission resolution
- Method annotations compiled into access control lists

**Resource Ownership Queries:**
- Group ownership paths pre-computed and denormalized
- Database indexes optimized for ownership filtering
- Hierarchical queries reduced to array membership tests
