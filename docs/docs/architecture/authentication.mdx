# Authentication

Understanding authentication methods for the Mesh API.

## Authentication Methods

### API Key Authentication

The primary authentication method for programmatic access to the Mesh API.

**Header Format:**
```
Authorization: Bearer {api_key}
x-group: groups/{group_ulid}
```

**Key Characteristics:**
- API keys are generated when creating API users
- Each API key belongs to a specific group context
- API keys can be activated or deactivated for access control
- Bearer token format for standard HTTP authorization

**Example:**
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer mesh_12345abcdef..." \
     -H "x-group: groups/{group_ulid}" \
     https://api.mesh.dev/iam/api_user/v1/api_users
```

### Group Context

All API operations require a group context header that specifies which group the operation should be performed within.

**Purpose:**
- Provides resource isolation between different organizations
- Enforces multi-tenancy boundaries
- Ensures users can only access resources they own

## SDK Configuration

For detailed information about configuring SDK clients, including advanced features like OpenTelemetry tracing, TLS/mTLS support, timeout handling, and resource management, see the [SDK Configuration](./sdk-configuration.mdx) documentation.

## Security Best Practices

### API Key Management
- Store API keys securely (environment variables, secret managers)
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use different API keys for different environments

### Group Context Security
- Always validate group context matches your organization
- Don't hardcode group IDs in applications
- Use environment-specific group configurations

### Network Security
- Use TLS in production environments
- Consider mTLS for high-security requirements
- Implement proper certificate validation

### Access Control
- Follow principle of least privilege when assigning roles
- Regularly audit API user permissions
- Deactivate unused API users promptly
