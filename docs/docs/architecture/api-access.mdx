# Authentication

Understanding authentication methods for the Mesh API.

## Authentication Methods

### API Key Authentication

The primary authentication method for programmatic access to the Mesh API.

**Header Format:**
```
x-api-key: {api_key}
x-group: groups/{group_ulid}
```

**Key Characteristics:**
API keys are generated when creating API users.
- See **[Resource Hierarchy](/docs/architecture/resource-hierarchy)** or **[IAM API User Service Reference](/docs/api-reference/iam/api_user/v1)** for more.

### Group Context

All API operations require a group context header that specifies which group the operation should be performed within.

**Purpose:**
- Provides resource isolation between different organizations
- Enforces multi-tenancy boundaries
- Ensures users can only access resources they own

## SDK Configuration

For detailed information about configuring SDK clients, including advanced features like OpenTelemetry tracing, TLS support, timeout handling, and resource management, see the [SDK Configuration](./sdk-configuration.mdx) documentation.

## Security Best Practices

### API Key Management
- Store API keys securely (environment variables, secret managers)
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use different API keys for different environments

### Group Context Security
- Always validate group context matches your organization
- Don't hardcode group IDs in applications
- Use environment-specific group configurations

### Access Control
- Follow principle of least privilege when assigning roles
- Regularly audit API user permissions
- Deactivate unused API users promptly
