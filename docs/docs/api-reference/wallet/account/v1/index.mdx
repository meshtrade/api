## Overview

The **AccountService** manages blockchain wallet accounts across multiple ledger networks (Stellar, Solana, Bitcoin, Ethereum etc.).
This service provides comprehensive account lifecycle management, from creation through closure, along with balance queries and metadata management.

Accounts serve as the primary containers for holding and managing digital assets on the Mesh platform. Each account is:
- **Ledger-specific**: Tied to a single blockchain network
- **Hierarchically owned**: Part of your group's organizational structure  
- **Uniquely numbered**: Identified by a 7-digit Unique Mesh Account Number (UMAN)
- **Multi-asset capable**: Can hold multiple instrument balances within its ledger

## Common Workflows

### Account Lifecycle Management

1. **Create Account** - Register account in system (off-chain)
2. **Open Account** - Initialize on blockchain (on-chain)
3. **Use Account** - Receive deposits, execute trades
4. **Query Balances** - Monitor holdings with live data
5. **Close Account** - Deactivate when no longer needed

## Key Concepts

### Account Numbers

Each account receives a unique Mesh 7-digit number starting with '1' (e.g., `1234567`). This Unique Mesh Account Number provides:
- Easy account identification
- Simplified inter-account transfers
- Human-friendly references

### Ledger Support

Accounts can be created on four blockchain networks:

| Ledger | Use Case | Address Format | Status|
|--------|----------|----------------|---|
| **Stellar** | Fast settlements, stablecoins | Ed25519 public key | Live|
| **Solana** | High-throughput trading | Ed25519 public key |Coming Soon|
| **Bitcoin** | Store of value | secp256k1 address |Coming Soon|
| **Ethereum** | DeFi integration | secp256k1 address |Coming Soon|

### Live Ledger Data

The `populate_ledger_data` parameter in read requests (Get, List, Search) controls whether to fetch current blockchain state:

- **`false`**: Returns stored account metadata only (faster)
- **`true`**: Returns live balances and state from blockchain (slower)

Use live data for:
- Balance verification before trades
- Account state confirmation
- Audit and reporting

Use cached data for:
- Account listing and browsing
- Display name lookups
- Bulk operations

## Authentication & Authorization

The AccountService uses role-based access control:

### Write Operations
Require `ROLE_WALLET_ADMIN` or `ROLE_WALLET_ACCOUNT_ADMIN`:
- CreateAccount
- UpdateAccount  
- OpenAccount
- CloseAccount

### Read Operations
Require any wallet role (`ADMIN` or `VIEWER` variants):
- GetAccount
- GetAccountByNumber
- ListAccounts
- SearchAccounts

All operations are scoped to your group's hierarchy - you can only access accounts owned by your group or its descendants.
You can only operate on accounts in your executing group.

## Best Practices

1. **Account Creation**: Always specify a descriptive `display_name` for easy identification
2. **Ledger Selection**: Choose the appropriate ledger based on your trading needs
3. **Balance Queries**: Use `populate_ledger_data=false` for listing, `true` for trading decisions
4. **Error Handling**: Check account state before operations - closed accounts cannot transact
5. **Monitoring**: Track the `ledger_transaction` reference when opening/closing accounts
