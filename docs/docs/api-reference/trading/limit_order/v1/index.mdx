## Overview

LimitOrderService manages limit orders for trading operations on supported ledgers (currently Stellar).

This service provides comprehensive limit order management capabilities including:
- **Order creation** with flexible pricing and quantity specifications
- **Order cancellation** for active orders
- **Order querying** by resource name or external reference
- **Order listing and searching** with optional filters
- **Real-time monitoring** via server-side streaming
- **Live ledger data** integration for up-to-date order status

All operations are scoped to the authenticated group's hierarchy and require appropriate trading domain permissions.

Note: This service is currently in BETA. Interface and functionality may change.

## Key Features

### Live Ledger Data
Many read operations support an optional `live_ledger_data` flag that enriches responses with real-time ledger state:
- When `false` (default): Returns persisted order metadata with `LIMIT_ORDER_STATUS_UNSPECIFIED`
- When `true`: Queries the underlying ledger and populates current order status (e.g., `LIMIT_ORDER_STATUS_OPEN`, `LIMIT_ORDER_STATUS_FILLED`)

### External References
Each limit order can be tagged with a unique `external_reference` string, enabling:
- Integration with external trading systems
- Order tracking across multiple systems
- Quick lookup via `GetLimitOrderByExternalReference`

### Resource Hierarchy
Limit orders belong to accounts, which belong to groups:
```
groups/{group_id}/accounts/{account_id}/limitOrders/{order_id}
```

## Quick Start

1. **Obtain credentials** with `ROLE_TRADING_LIMIT_ORDER_ADMIN` or `ROLE_TRADING_LIMIT_ORDER_VIEWER`
2. **Create an account** on your desired ledger (e.g., Stellar) using the Wallet Account service
3. **Create a limit order** specifying price, quantity, and order side (buy/sell)
4. **Monitor your order** using `GetLimitOrder` with `live_ledger_data: true` or stream updates via `MonitorLimitOrder`

## Common Workflows

### Creating a Buy Order
```
1. Ensure you have a Stellar account (via Wallet Account service)
2. Call CreateLimitOrder with:
   - account: Your account resource name
   - side: LIMIT_ORDER_SIDE_BUY
   - limit_price: Maximum price willing to pay (e.g., 100.50 USDC)
   - quantity: Amount to purchase (e.g., 10 USDC)
   - external_reference: Optional unique identifier for your system
3. Receive LimitOrder response with system-generated resource name
```

### Checking Order Status
```
1. Call GetLimitOrder with live_ledger_data: true
2. Inspect the status field:
   - LIMIT_ORDER_STATUS_OPEN: Order is active on the ledger
   - LIMIT_ORDER_STATUS_FILLED: Order has been completely filled
   - LIMIT_ORDER_STATUS_PARTIALLY_FILLED: Order is partially executed
   - LIMIT_ORDER_STATUS_CANCELLED: Order was successfully cancelled
```

### Cancelling an Order
```
1. Call CancelLimitOrder with the order's resource name
2. Receive response with terminal cancellation status:
   - LIMIT_ORDER_STATUS_CANCELLATION_IN_PROGRESS: Cancel submitted to ledger
   - LIMIT_ORDER_STATUS_CANCELLED: Cancel confirmed on ledger
```

### Monitoring Orders in Real-Time
```
1. Call MonitorLimitOrder (server-streaming RPC)
2. Specify optional filters (account, external_reference, etc.)
3. Receive continuous stream of order updates as ledger state changes
4. React to status changes, fills, or cancellations in real-time
```

### Searching Historical Orders
```
1. Call SearchLimitOrders with optional filters:
   - account: Filter by specific account
   - external_reference: Filter by your system's ID
   - live_ledger_data: Enrich with current status
2. Iterate through paginated results
3. Use page_token for next page of results
```

## Authentication & Authorization

This service requires role-based permissions from the trading domain:

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| `ROLE_TRADING_LIMIT_ORDER_ADMIN` | Full access: create, cancel, read all orders in group hierarchy |
| `ROLE_TRADING_LIMIT_ORDER_VIEWER` | Read-only access: get, list, search, monitor orders in group hierarchy |

All RPCs validate that the caller's group matches or is an ancestor of the requested resource's owner group.
