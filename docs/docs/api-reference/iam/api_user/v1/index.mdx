## Overview

ApiUserService manages API user lifecycle and authentication credentials.

API users represent automated clients that can authenticate with API keys
and perform operations within a specific group context. Each API user has:
- A unique identifier and display name
- Group ownership for resource isolation
- Role-based permissions for authorization
- Active/inactive state for access control

All operations require IAM domain permissions and operate within
the authenticated group context.
