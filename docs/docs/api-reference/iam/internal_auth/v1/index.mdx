## Overview

InternalAuthorizationService provides authorization services for internal communication
 between microservices within the mesh. This service receives authorization requests
 from the api-gateway-sidecar and delegates to the main authoriser app's business logic.

 This protocol is designed specifically for internal service-to-service communication
 and should not be exposed to external clients.
