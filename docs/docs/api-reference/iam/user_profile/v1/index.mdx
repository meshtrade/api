## Overview

The **UserProfileService** manages user profile information and preferences within the Mesh IAM system.

User profiles contain display preferences, localization settings, and personalization data for authenticated users. Each profile is linked to a specific user and owned by a group, enabling organizations to manage user presentation and experience settings across the platform.

### Key Features

- **Profile Management**: Create, update, and retrieve user profile information
- **User Lookup**: Find profiles by user ID or profile ID
- **Search & Filter**: Search profiles by display name, email, or owner group
- **Personalization**: Manage display preferences including locale, currency, and profile pictures
- **Multi-tenancy**: Group-based ownership with hierarchical access control

## Quick Start

1. **Configure your client** with the appropriate credentials
2. **Choose your operations** from the available service methods
3. **Review the types** to understand request/response structures

## Common Workflows

### Creating a User Profile

1. Create a user in the IAM system
2. Call `CreateUserProfile` with the user reference and required fields (owner, display_name)
3. Optionally set locale, currencies, and profile picture

### Retrieving Profile Information

- **By Profile ID**: Use `GetUserProfile` with the profile resource name
- **By User ID**: Use `GetUserProfileByUser` with the user resource name

### Searching Profiles

Use `SearchUserProfiles` to find profiles by:
- Display name (case-insensitive partial matching)
- Email address (case-insensitive partial matching)
- Owner group (exact match)

Results can be sorted by name or display_name in ascending or descending order.
