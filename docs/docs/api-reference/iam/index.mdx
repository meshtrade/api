# IAM Domain

Identity and Access Management (IAM) services provide authentication, authorization, and user management capabilities for the Mesh platform.

## Services

### API User Service
Manages API users and their authentication credentials. API users represent automated clients that can authenticate with API keys and perform operations within a specific group context.

**[View API User Service Documentation â†’](./api_user/v1/)**

## Key Concepts

### API Users
API users are automated clients that authenticate using API keys rather than human user credentials. Each API user:

- Belongs to a specific group for resource isolation
- Has assigned roles that determine their permissions
- Can be activated or deactivated to control access
- Generates a unique API key for authentication

### Authentication Flow
1. Create an API user with required roles
2. Activate the API user to enable the API key
3. Use the API key in the `Authorization: Bearer {api_key}` header
4. Include group context in the `x-group-id` header

### Authorization
All IAM operations require appropriate domain permissions:

- **ROLE_IAM_ADMIN** - Can create, activate, deactivate API users
- **ROLE_IAM_VIEWER** - Can read API user information

## Coming Soon

Additional IAM services currently in development:

- **Group Service** - Group management and hierarchy
- **Role Service** - Role definitions and assignments
- **User Service** - Human user management
