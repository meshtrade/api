## Overview

The `GroupService` provides comprehensive management of organizational hierarchies within Mesh. Groups serve as the fundamental multi-tenancy units that:

- **Own Resources**: Groups can own sub-groups, users, API users, accounts, and trading resources
- **Define Boundaries**: Each group creates isolated tenancy boundaries for resource access
- **Enable Inheritance**: Hierarchical structures allow permission and access inheritance from parent to child groups
- **Support Organization**: Groups model real-world organizational structures and business units

The service provides five core operations for complete lifecycle management:
- **CreateGroup**: Establish new child groups within the hierarchy
- **UpdateGroup**: Modify group metadata while preserving identity
- **ListGroups**: Retrieve all accessible groups in the organizational structure
- **SearchGroups**: Find groups using flexible text-based criteria
- **GetGroup**: Access individual group details by resource identifier

Access requires IAM domain permissions with role-based access control determining operation scope.

## Group Hierarchy Model

Groups form tree structures with sophisticated ownership patterns:

### Ownership Structure
- **Direct Owner**: Each group has one immediate parent (stored in the `owner` field)
- **Full Hierarchy**: Complete ownership chain maintained automatically (stored in the `owners` array)
- **Access Inheritance**: Child groups inherit access permissions from their ancestry

### Resource Isolation
- **Tenant Boundaries**: Groups provide complete isolation between organizational units
- **Scoped Operations**: All operations are scoped to the authenticated group's accessible hierarchy
- **Permission Inheritance**: Users and API users inherit access based on their group membership
- **Resource Ownership**: All platform resources (accounts, trades, instruments) are owned by specific groups

## Quick Start

1. **Configure your client** with appropriate IAM credentials and group context
2. **Identify your hierarchy scope** - WRITE operations are limited to your authenticated group's tree
3. **Choose operations** based on your role (admin roles for read & write operations, viewer roles for read operations)
4. **Review group structure** using ListGroups to understand your organizational context

## Common Workflows

### Create Organizational Sub-Units
Use `CreateGroup` to establish new organizational boundaries within your hierarchy:
- New groups become children of the authenticated group context
- System generates unique identifiers and establishes ownership relationships
- Group inherits access patterns from parent while creating new isolation boundaries
- Metadata fields (display_name, description) provide human-readable identification

### Maintain Group Metadata
Use `UpdateGroup` to modify group information while preserving identity:
- Only display_name and description fields can be modified
- Group identity (name) and ownership (owner) remain immutable
- Changes maintain consistency across the organizational hierarchy
- Updates preserve all existing resource ownership and access patterns

### Navigate Organizational Structure
Use `ListGroups` to understand the complete accessible hierarchy:
- Returns authenticated group plus all descendant groups
- Provides complete organizational context for resource ownership
- Supports sorting for organized presentation
- Includes full ownership chain information for each group

### Locate Specific Groups
Use `SearchGroups` to find groups using flexible criteria:
- Case-insensitive substring matching on display names and descriptions
- OR logic combines multiple search terms for broader results
- Maintains hierarchical scoping - only searches accessible groups
- Supports sorting to organize results meaningfully

## Data Consistency

The group service maintains several consistency guarantees:

### Identity Consistency
- **Immutable Names**: Group resource names never change once assigned
- **Stable Ownership**: Parent-child relationships are permanent once established
- **Unique Identifiers**: System-generated ULIDv2 identifiers ensure global uniqueness

### Hierarchy Consistency  
- **Ownership Validation**: All operations validate group ownership against executing context
- **Access Scoping**: Read operations automatically filter to accessible hierarchy scope
- **Permission Alignment**: Write operations require ownership alignment with executing context

## Authentication & Authorization

This service implements role-based access control with hierarchical scoping:

### Write Operations (CreateGroup, UpdateGroup)
- **Required Roles**: `ROLE_IAM_ADMIN` or `ROLE_IAM_GROUP_ADMIN`
- **Ownership Constraint**: Can only operate on groups owned by the executing context
- **Method Type**: `METHOD_TYPE_WRITE` for direct ownership validation

### Read Operations (ListGroups, SearchGroups, GetGroup)  
- **Required Roles**: `ROLE_IAM_ADMIN`, `ROLE_IAM_VIEWER`, `ROLE_IAM_GROUP_ADMIN`, or `ROLE_IAM_GROUP_VIEWER`
- **Hierarchy Scoping**: Automatically limited to accessible organizational scope
- **Method Type**: `METHOD_TYPE_READ` for extended hierarchical access

All operations operate within the authenticated group context and respect the hierarchical access patterns established by the organization's group structure.
