## Overview

The Token Tap Service provides utilities for token minting and management in a testing environment. This service is designed to facilitate testing of ledger operations by allowing you to mint test tokens, manage token taps, and initialize the tapping infrastructure.

### Key Capabilities

- **Initialize Token Taps**: Set up and configure token tapping infrastructure for your test environment
- **List Available Tokens**: Discover which tokens are available for minting through the tap service
- **Mint Test Tokens**: Create and distribute test tokens to specified addresses with support for multiple blockchain networks (Stellar and Solana)

## Quick Start

1. **Initialize the Token Tap Service** using `InitialiseTokenTaps` to set up your testing infrastructure
2. **List Available Tokens** with `ListTokenTaps` to see which tokens you can mint
3. **Mint Tokens** using `MintToken` with your desired amount, recipient address, and optional blockchain-specific parameters

## Common Workflows

### Setting Up a Test Environment

```
1. Call InitialiseTokenTaps to initialize the tapping infrastructure
2. Call ListTokenTaps to discover available test tokens
3. Call MintToken multiple times to distribute test tokens to various test accounts
```

### Minting Tokens for Different Networks

The `MintToken` method supports both Stellar and Solana networks through the `options` parameter:

- **Stellar**: Use `StellarMintOptions` to include transaction memos and other Stellar-specific metadata
- **Solana**: Use `SolanaMintOptions` to specify token program versions (Legacy or 2022)

## Authentication & Authorization

This service is publicly accessible (no specific role requirements) and is intended for use in testing environments only. Always use this service on test networks or isolated test environments, never against production systems.
