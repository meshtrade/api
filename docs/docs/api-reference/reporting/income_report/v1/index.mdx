## Overview

IncomeReportService manages the generation and export of income reports.

Income reports provide structured financial insights for a given account, over a defined time range, and denominated in a chosen reporting currency. Clients can view detailed breakdowns or export reports in Excel format for further analysis and sharing.

Each income report includes:

Account-based scope for financial reporting

Configurable reporting period (start and end timestamps)

Reporting currency selection for consistent valuation

Role-based access control requiring reporting permissions

All operations require reporting domain permissions and are accessible only to authorized roles (e.g., Report Viewer).

This service is essential for financial transparency, performance tracking, and audit-ready reporting.
