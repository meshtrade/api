## Overview

The `AccountReportService` provides two primary methods for comprehensive account activity reporting:

- **`GetAccountReport`**: Returns structured account data as an `AccountReport` message containing income transactions, fee entries, and trading statements
- **`GetExcelAccountReport`**: Returns the same report data as a base64-encoded Excel file for download and distribution

Both methods generate reports for a specified account over a given time range, with all values denominated in a specified reporting currency token (such as mZAR, other stablecoins or even Cryptocurrencies).

Access requires financial reporting permissions (`ROLE_REPORTING_ADMIN` or `ROLE_REPORTING_VIEWER`).

## Report Components

The AccountReport provides a comprehensive view of account activity including:

### Transaction Data
- **Income Entries**: Detailed records of all income transactions
  - Yield income from staking, lending, or liquidity provision
  - Coupon payments from bonds and fixed-income instruments
  - Asset-specific income with original and reporting currency values
- **Fee Entries**: Complete breakdown of fees charged during the period
  - Transaction fees with unique identifiers
  - Currency-denominated fee amounts
  - Full audit trail with timestamps
- **Trading Statement Entries**: Full trading activity and position changes
  - Individual trade records with prices and costs
  - Running balance calculations after each transaction
  - Support for deposits, withdrawals, and trades

### Metadata & Context
- **Client Information**: Account holder details including name and address
- **Reporting Metadata**: Period coverage, generation date, and currency denomination
- **Disclaimers**: Legal notices and regulatory disclosures

## Quick Start

1. **Configure your client** with the appropriate credentials
2. **Choose your operations** from the available service methods
3. **Review the types** to understand request/response structures

## Common Workflows

### Generate a Complete Account Report
Use the `GetAccountReport` method to retrieve a comprehensive account report for a specific period. This method returns an `AccountReport` message containing:
- All income streams (yield, coupons) in the `income_entries` field
- Transaction fees and charges in the `fee_entries` field
- Complete trading history with balances in the `trading_statement_entries` field
- Client details and period metadata in dedicated fields
- All monetary values denominated in the specified reporting currency token

### Export to Excel
Use the `GetExcelAccountReport` method to download the account report as a formatted Excel file. This method returns a `GetExcelAccountReportResponse` containing:
- A base64-encoded Excel file in the `excel_base64` field for secure transmission
- All report sections organized in separate worksheets
- Formatted dates and numeric values for readability
- Structure suitable for archival and audit purposes

## Data Validation

Both methods require the following parameters:
- **Account Number**: Must be numeric digits only (validated with regex `^[0-9]{1,}$` in Excel method)
- **Date Range**: Both `from` and `to` timestamps are required
- **Period Bounds**: Dates are inclusive on both ends
- **Reporting Currency Token**: Token specifying the currency for all report values (e.g., mZAR for South African Rand)

The `GetExcelAccountReport` method enforces strict validation rules in the protobuf definition, while `GetAccountReport` uses the same parameters with server-side validation.

## Authentication & Authorization

This service requires appropriate role-based permissions:
- **ROLE_REPORT_ADMIN**: Full access to generate and export reports
- **ROLE_REPORT_VIEWER**: Read-only access to view reports

Both methods are read operations (`METHOD_TYPE_READ`) that do not modify system state.
