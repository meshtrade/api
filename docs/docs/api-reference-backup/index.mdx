## Architecture Overview

Before diving into specific APIs, we recommend understanding the core architectural concepts:

- **[Service Structure](../architecture/service-structure)** - Service-oriented design patterns
- **[Group Ownership](../architecture/group-ownership)** - Multi-tenancy and resource isolation  
- **[Role-Based Access](../architecture/role-based-access)** - Authorization and permissions
- **[Authentication](../architecture/authentication)** - SDK features and API key usage

## Getting Help

- Check the [Architecture](../architecture/service-structure) section for design patterns
- Review service-specific documentation for detailed method information  
- See code examples for practical implementation guidance
